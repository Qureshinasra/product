            Clothing is worn where the human body needs protection; from the sun and dust in
             hot, dry countries lacking shade and from the cold and wet in temperate climates.
            Clothing such as thick wool coats and boots keeps the human body warm in
             very cold temperatures (such as in the arctic).Clothing is usually made of
            fabric sewn together, but may also be animal skins. Each body part has 
             typical item of clothing. The torso can be covered by shirts, arms by sleeves, 
             legs by pants or skirts, hands by gloves, feet by footwear, and head by headgear
              or masks. In cold climates, people also wear heavy, thick coats such as overcoats.
